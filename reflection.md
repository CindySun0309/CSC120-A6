- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I learned some inheritance ideas in CSC111 class (python) so I think it is not that hard to understand. I think this topic is easier to understand than the last topic (or last assignment of building a train, engine...)

Note for restock() method in Cafe class: When I wrote this method, I was thinking to restock the right amount of required resources, so that there will be no excess inventory. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would suggest them to not think too much when writing the assignment. Ask tutors or the professor would help. The example (class note posed by Jordan) really helped a lot in writing this assignment.
